# CSPC-454-Project

The creation of a website that will serve as a resource to provide an overview for both tourists and residents about the different beaches of California. The website will provide information such as the water quality, the dangers that are present, the different animals that inhabit the beaches, and more useful information. The information that will be provided will be up to date and kept as accurate as possible for the user. The website will also serve as a connection to Coastal Conservation by providing data and links to these organizations. The goal of the site is to inform individuals and hopefully give them a different frame of mind the next time they go to the beach.
